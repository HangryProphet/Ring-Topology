Fix Log - Ring Topology Simulator

1. Fixed missing updateNodeVisual function in healRing 
   - Changed to use the existing updateVisuals function
   - This was causing an error when running Ring Diagnostics after turning off a node

2. Fixed validation in packet sending
   - Enhanced canTransmit function to properly check for inactive nodes in both source and target
   - Added proper check when sending packets to prevent transmission to inactive nodes

These fixes ensure:
- Ring Diagnostics works correctly
- Packets can't be sent to broken/closed nodes
- Better error handling for network validation
